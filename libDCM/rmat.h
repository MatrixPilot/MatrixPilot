#ifndef RMAT_H
#define RMAT_H

//  These are the routines for maintaining a direction cosine matrix
//    that can be used to transform vectors between the earth and plane
//    coordinate systems. The 9 direction cosines in the matrix completely
//    define the orientation of the plane with respect to the earth.
//  The inverse of the matrix is equal to its transpose. This defines
//    the so-called orthogonality conditions, which impose 6 constraints on
//    the 9 elements of the matrix.

//  All numbers are stored in 2.14 format.
//  Vector and matrix libraries work in 1.15 format.
//  This combination allows values of matrix elements between -2 and +2.
//  Multiplication produces results scaled by 1/2.


// Outside of libDCM, these should all be treated as read-only
