  Summary:
    This file contains functions, macros, definitions, variables,
    datatypes, etc. that are required for use of the MSD function
    driver. This file should be included in projects that use the MSD
    \function driver.

  Description:
    USB MSD Function Driver File
    
    This file contains functions, macros, definitions, variables,
    datatypes, etc. that are required for use of the MSD function
    driver. This file should be included in projects that use the MSD
    \function driver.
    
    This file is located in the "\<Install Directory\>\\Microchip\\USB\\MSD
    Device Driver" directory.
    
    When including this file in a new project, this file can either be
    referenced from the directory in which it was installed or copied
    directly into the user application folder. If the first method is
    chosen to keep the file located in the folder in which it is installed
    then include paths need to be added so that the library and the
    application both know where to reference each others files. If the
    application folder is located in the same folder as the Microchip
    folder (like the current demo folders), then the following include
    paths need to be added to the application's project:
    
    ..\\..\\Microchip\\Include
    .
    
    If a different directory structure is used, modify the paths as
    required. An example using absolute paths instead of relative paths
    would be the following:
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\Microchip\\Include
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\My Demo Application

Change History:
  Rev         Description
  ----------  ----------------------------------------------------------
  2.6 - 2.7a  No change
  2.8		  Improved error case checking, error case recovery, and 
			  sense key/status reporting to the host.
  			  Implemented adjustable read/write failure retry feature.
			  Fixed minor bug that would have interfered with supporting 
			  more than 7 LUNs simultaneously.
  2.9         Added additional error case checking and handling so as to
              be able to pass all USB20CV MSC tests. Note: If using the internal
              flash demo, the MSD volume must be sized > 64kB, in order to pass 
              all USB20CV tests. The USB20CV MSC tests attempt to write up to 
              64kB worth of data during the test.  If the MSD volume is <64kB, 
              this portion of the test will fail, but this is intentional and 
              correct behavior, since we obviously can't successfully write more
              data than the entire drive volume size.
              General improvements/improved flows/improved inline code comments.
  2.9d        Added fix to allow MSD devices to be ejected in Mac OSX and so that
              read-only media does not create an error in Mac OSX every time it is
              enumerated.
