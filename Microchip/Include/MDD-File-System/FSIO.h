    one of three things will happen: if the file was opened in read mode, its
    file info will be loaded using the FILEopen function; if it was opened in
    write mode, it will be erased, and a new file will be constructed in
    its place; if it was opened in append mode, its file info will be
    loaded with FILEopen and the current location will be moved to the
    end of the file using the FSfseek function.  If the file was not
    found by FILEfind, a new file will be created if the mode was specified as
    a write or append mode.  In these cases, a pointer to the heap or

  Return Values:
    0 -    Format was successful
    EOF -  Format was unsuccessful
  Side Effects:
    The FSerrno variable will be changed.
  Description:
    The FSformat function can be used to create a new boot sector
    on a device, based on the information in the master boot record.
    This function will first initialize the I/O pins and the device,
    and then attempts to read the master boot record.  If the MBR
    cannot be loaded successfully, the function will fail.  Next, if
    the 'mode' argument is specified as '0' the existing boot sector
    information will be loaded.  If the 'mode' argument is '1' an
    entirely new boot sector will be constructed using the disk
    values from the master boot record.  Once the boot sector has
    been successfully loaded/created, the locations of the FAT and
    root will be loaded from it, and they will be completely
    erased.  If the user has specified a volumeID parameter, a 
    VOLUME attribute entry will be created in the root directory
    to name the device.

    FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 formatting are supported.

    Based on the number of sectors, the format function automatically
    compute the smallest possible value for the cluster size in order to
    accommodate the physical size of the media. In this case, if a media 
    with a big capacity is formatted, the format function may take a very
    long time to write all the FAT tables. 

    Therefore, the FORMAT_SECTORS_PER_CLUSTER macro may be used to 
    specify the exact cluster size (in multiples of sector size). This 
    macro can be defined in FSconfig.h

  Remarks:
    Only devices with a sector size of 512 bytes are supported by the 
    format function

    subdirectory immediately before calling this function.  The
    function will then copy the current working directory name 
    into the buffer backwards, and insert a backslash character.  
    Next, the function will continuously switch to the previous 
    directories and copy their names backwards into the buffer
    until it reaches the root.  If the buffer overflows, it
    will be treated as a circular buffer, and data will be
    copied over existing characters, starting at the beginning.
    Once the root directory is reached, the text in the buffer
    will be swapped, so that the buffer contains as much of the

/*********************************************************************************
  Function:
    int FSCreateMBR (unsigned long firstSector, unsigned long numSectors)
  Summary:
    Creates a master boot record
  Conditions:
    The I/O pins for the device have been initialized by the InitIO function.
  Input:
    firstSector -  The first sector of the partition on the device (cannot
                   be 0; that's the MBR)
    numSectors -   The number of sectors available in memory (including the
                   MBR)
  Return Values:
    0 -   MBR was created successfully
    EOF - MBR could not be created
  Side Effects:
    None
  Description:  
    This function can be used to create a master boot record for a device.  Note
    that this function should not be used on a device that is already formatted
    with a master boot record (i.e. most SD cards, CF cards, USB keys).  This
    function will fill the global data buffer with appropriate partition information
    for a FAT partition with a type determined by the number of sectors available
    to the partition.  It will then write the MBR information to the first sector
    on the device.  This function should be followed by a call to FSformat, which
    will create a boot sector, root dir, and FAT appropriate the the information
    contained in the new master boot record.  Note that FSformat only supports
    FAT12 and FAT16 formatting at this time, and so cannot be used to format a
    device with more than 0x3FFD5F sectors.
  Remarks:
    This function can damage the device being used, and should not be called
    unless the user is sure about the size of the device and the first sector value.

#ifdef ALLOW_GET_DISK_PROPERTIES
/*********************************************************************************
  Function:
    void FSGetDiskProperties(FS_DISK_PROPERTIES* properties)
  Summary:
    Allows user to get the disk properties (size of disk, free space, etc)
  Conditions:
    1) ALLOW_GET_DISK_PROPERTIES must be defined in FSconfig.h
    2) a FS_DISK_PROPERTIES object must be created before the function is called
    3) the new_request member of the FS_DISK_PROPERTIES object must be set before
        calling the function for the first time.  This will start a new search.
    4) this function should not be called while there is a file open.  Close all
        files before calling this function.
  Input:
    properties - a pointer to a FS_DISK_PROPERTIES object where the results should
      be stored.
  Return Values:
    This function returns void.  The properties_status of the previous call of 
      this function is located in the properties.status field.  This field has 
      the following possible values:

    FS_GET_PROPERTIES_NO_ERRORS - operation completed without error.  Results
      are in the properties object passed into the function.
    FS_GET_PROPERTIES_DISK_NOT_MOUNTED - there is no mounted disk.  Results in
      properties object is not valid
    FS_GET_PROPERTIES_CLUSTER_FAILURE - there was a failure trying to read a 
      cluster from the drive.  The results in the properties object is a partial
      result up until the point of the failure.
    FS_GET_PROPERTIES_STILL_WORKING - the search for free sectors is still in
      process.  Continue calling this function with the same properties pointer 
      until either the function completes or until the partial results meets the
      application needs.  The properties object contains the partial results of
      the search and can be used by the application.  
  Side Effects:
    Can cause errors if called when files are open.  Close all files before
    calling this function.

    Calling this function without setting the new_request member on the first
    call can result in undefined behavior and results.

    Calling this function after a result is returned other than
    FS_GET_PROPERTIES_STILL_WORKING can result in undefined behavior and results.
  Description:  
    This function returns the information about the mounted drive.  The results 
    member of the properties object passed into the function is populated with 
    the information about the drive.    

    Before starting a new request, the new_request member of the properties
    input parameter should be set to TRUE.  This will initiate a new search
    request.

    This function will return before the search is complete with partial results.
    All of the results except the free_clusters will be correct after the first
    call.  The free_clusters will contain the number of free clusters found up
    until that point, thus the free_clusters result will continue to grow until
    the entire drive is searched.  If an application only needs to know that a 
    certain number of bytes is available and doesn't need to know the total free 
    size, then this function can be called until the required free size is
    verified.  To continue a search, pass a pointer to the same FS_DISK_PROPERTIES
    object that was passed in to create the search.

    A new search request sould be made once this function has returned a value 
    other than FS_GET_PROPERTIES_STILL_WORKING.  Continuing a completed search
    can result in undefined behavior or results.

    Typical Usage:
    <code>
    FS_DISK_PROPERTIES disk_properties;

    disk_properties.new_request = TRUE;

    do
    {
        FSGetDiskProperties(&disk_properties);
    } while (disk_properties.properties_status == FS_GET_PROPERTIES_STILL_WORKING);
    </code>

    results.disk_format - contains the format of the drive.  Valid results are 
      FAT12(1), FAT16(2), or FAT32(3).

    results.sector_size - the sector size of the mounted drive.  Valid values are
      512, 1024, 2048, and 4096.

    results.sectors_per_cluster - the number sectors per cluster.

    results.total_clusters - the number of total clusters on the drive.  This 
      can be used to calculate the total disk size (total_clusters * 
      sectors_per_cluster * sector_size = total size of drive in bytes)

    results.free_clusters - the number of free (unallocated) clusters on the drive.
      This can be used to calculate the total free disk size (free_clusters * 
      sectors_per_cluster * sector_size = total size of drive in bytes)

  Remarks:
    PIC24F size estimates:
      Flash - 400 bytes (-Os setting)

    PIC24F speed estimates:
      Search takes approximately 7 seconds per Gigabyte of drive space.  Speed
        will vary based on the number of sectors per cluster and the sector size.
