/****************************************************************************
*
* Interface to vector operations.
*
* A vector is a collection of numerical values, the vector elements,
* allocated contiguosly in memory, with the first element at the
* lowest memory address. One word of memory (two bytes) is used to
* store the value of each element, and this quantity must be interpreted
* as a fractional value in Q.15 format.
*
* A pointer addressing the first element of the vector is used as
* a handle which provides access to each of the vector values. The
* one dimensional arrangement of a vector fits with the memory
* storage model, so that the n-th element of an N-element vector
* can be accessed from the vector's base address BA as:
*
*       BA +  (n-1)*2,
*
* Note that because of the byte addressing capabilities of the dsPIC30F,
* the addressing of vector elements uses an increment (or decrement) size
* of 2: INC2 (or DEC2) instruction.
*
* Unary and binary operations are prototyped in this interface. The
* operand vector in a unary operation is called the source vector.
* In a binary operation the first operand is referred to as source
* one vector, and the second as source two vector. Each operation
* applies some computation to one or several elements of the source
* vector(s). Some operations result in a scalar value (also to be
* interpreted as a Q.15 fractional number), others in a vector. When
* the result is also a vector this is referred to as the destination
* vector.
*
* Some operations resulting in a vector allow computation in place;
* i.e., the results of the operations are placed back on the source
* (or source one, if binary) vector. In this case, the destination
* vector is said to (physically) replace the source (one) vector.
* When an operation can be computed in place it is indicated as such
* in the comments provided with its prototype.
*
* For some binary operations, the two operands can be the same (physical)
* source vector: the operation is applied between the source vector
* and itself. If this type of computation is possible for a given
* operation, it is indicated as such in the comments provided with
* its prototype.
*
* Some operations can be self applicable and computed in place.
*
* The operations prototyped in this interface take as an argument the
* cardinality (number of elements) of the operand vector(s). It is
* assumed that this number is in the range {1, 2, ..., (2^14)-1}, and
* that in the case of binary operations both operand vectors have the
* same cardinality. Note that no boundary checking is performed by
* the operations, and that out of range cardinalities as well as the
* use of source vectors of different sizes in binary operations may
* produce unexpected results.
*
* Additional remarks.
*
* A) Operations which return a destination vector can be nested, so that
*    for instance if:
*
*       a = Op1 (b, c), with b = Op2 (d), and c = Op3 (e, f), then
*
*       a = Op1 (Op2 (d), Op3 (e, f))
*
* B) The vector dot product and power operations could lead to saturation
*    if the sum of products is greater than 1-2^(-15) or smaller than -1.
*
* C) All the functions have been designed to operate on vectors allocated
*    in default RAM memory space (X-Data or Y-Data).
*
* D) The sum of sizes of the vector(s) involved in an operation must not
*    exceed the available memory in the target device.

*
* Interface to windowing operations.
*
* A window is a vector with a specific value distribution within its
* domain ( 0 <= n < numElems). The particular value distribution depends
* on the window being generated.
*
* Given a vector, its value distribution may be modified by applying
* a window to it. In these cases, the window must have the same number
* of elements as the vector to modify.
*
* Before a vector can be windowed, the window must be created. Window
* initialization operations are provided which generate the values of
* the window elements. For higher numerical precision, these values are
* computed in floating point arithmetic, and the resulting quantities
* stored as Q.15 fractionals.
*
* To avoid excessive overhead when applying a window operation, and since
* given a window length the values of the window elements are fixed, a
* particular window could be generated once and used many times during
* the execution of the program. Thus, it is advisable to store the window
* returned by any of the initialization operations in a permanent (static)
* vector.
*
* Additional remarks.
*
* A) All the window initialization functions have been designed to generate
*    window vectors allocated in default RAM memory space (X-Data and Y-Data).
*
* B) The windowing function is designed to operate on vectors allocated
*    in default RAM memory space (X-Data and Y-Data).

/****************************************************************************
*
* Interface to matrix operations.
*
* A matrix is a collection of numerical values, the matrix elements,
* allocated contiguosly in memory, with the first element at the
* lowest memory address. One word of memory (two bytes) is used to
* store the value of each element, and this quantity must be interpreted
* as a fractional value in Q.15 format.
*
* A pointer addressing the first element of the matrix is used as
* a handle which provides access to each of the matrix values. The
* two dimensional arrangement of a matrix is emulated in the memory
* storage area by placing its elements organized in row major order.
* Thus, the first value in memeory is the first element of the first
* row. It is followed by the rest of the elements of the first row.
* Then, the elements of the second row are stored, and so on, until
* all the rows are in memory. This way, the element at row r and
* column c of a matrix with R rows and C columns is located from
* the matrix base address BA at:
*
*       BA + ((r-1)*C + c-1)*2,
*
* Note that because of the byte addressing capabilities of the dsPIC30F,
* the addressing of a matrix element uses an increment (or decrement)
* size of 2: INC2 (or DEC2) instruction.
*
* Unary and binary operations are prototyped in this interface. The
* operand matrix in a unary operation is called the source matrix.
* In a binary operation the first operand is referred to as source
* one matrix, and the second as source two matrix. Each operation
* applies some computation to one or several elements of the source
* matrix(ces). The operations result in a matrix, referred to as the
* destination matrix.
*
* Some operations resulting in a matrix allow computation in place;
* i.e., the results of the computation are placed back on the source
* (or source one, if binary) matrix. In this case, the destination
* matrix is said to (physically) replace the source (one) matrix.
* When an operation can be computed in place it is indicated as such
* in the comments provided with its prototype.
*
* For some binary operations, the two operands can be the same (physical)
* source matrix: the operation is applied between the source matrix
* and itself. If this type of computation is possible for a given
* operation, it is indicated as such in the comments provided with
* its prototype.
*
* Some operations can be self applicable and computed in place.
*
* The operations prototyped in this interface take the number of rows
* and the number of columns in the operand matrix(ces) as arguments.
* The number of rows times that of columns must be within the range
* {1, 2, ..., (2^14)-1}. In the case of binary operations the number
* of rows and columns of the operand matrices must obey the rules of
* matrix algebra; i.e., for matrix addition and subtraction the two
* matrices must have the same number of rows and columns, while for
* matrix multiplication, the number of columns of the first operand
* must be the same as the number of rows of the second operand. The
* source matrix to the inversion operation must be square (the same
* number of rows as of columns), and non-singular (its determinat
* different than zero).
*
* NOTE: no boundary checking is performed by the operations. So forth,
* out of range number of rows or columns as well as the use of source
* matrices not adhering to the previous rules may produce unexpected
* results.
*
* Additional remarks.
*
* A) Operations which return a destination matrix can be nested, so
*    that for instance if:
*
*       a = Op1 (b, c), with b = Op2 (d), and c = Op3 (e, f), then
*
*       a = Op1 (Op2 (d), Op3 (e, f))
*
* B) The computation of the inverse of a matrix takes as input a floating
*    point valued matrix, uses floating point arithmentic, and returns a
*    floating point valued matrix.
*
* C) All the functions have been designed to operate on matrices allocated
*    in default RAM memory space (X-Data and Y-Data).
*
* D) The sum of sizes of the matrix(ces) involved in an operation must not
*    exceed the available memory in the target device.

*
* Interface to FIR filter operations.
*
* Filtering a data sequence x[n] with an FIR filter of impulse response
* b[m] (0<= m < M) is equivalent to solving the difference equation:
*
*       y[n] = sum_{m = 0:M-1}(b[m]*x[n-m])
*
* In this operation it is important to know and manage the past history
* of the data sequence (x[m], -M+1 <= m < 0) which represent the initial
* condition of the filtering operation. Also, when applying an FIR filter
* to contiguous sections of a data sequence it is necessary to remember
* the final state of the previous filtering operation (x[m], N-M+1 <= m < N-1),
* and take the state into consideration for the calculations of the next
* filtering stage. Accounting for the past history and current state is
* required to perform a correct (glitch-free) filtering operation.
*
* The management of the past history and current state of the filtering
* operation is commonly implemented via an additional sequence, referred
* to as the delay. Prior to a filtering operation the delay describes the
* past history of the data sequence. After performing the FIR filtering
* the delay contains a set of the most recently filtered data samples.
* (For correct operation, it is advisable to initialize the delay values
* to zero by calling the corresponding init function.)
*
* Even though FIR filtering is a difference equation, several properties
* of FIR filters allow for computation of the operation in more effective
* ways than that of a straight difference equation. Consequently, a set
* of such implementations are hereby provided.
*
* Note that of the four main sequences involved in FIR filtering, input
* data, output data, filter coefficients and delay, the last two are
* usually thought of as making up the filter structure. All the functions
* that follow use the same FIR filter structure to manage the filtering
* operation.
*
* In the current design, the input data sequence is referred to as the
* sequence of source samples, while the resulting filtered sequence
* contains the destination samples. The filters are characterized by
* the number of coefficients or taps, and the delay properties. All of
* these data sets are stored in memory as vectors with their elements
* representing Q.15 fractional quantities. Also, the input and output
* sequences to the filtering operation ought to be allocated in default
* RAM memory (X-Data or Y-Data). The coefficients may be allocated either
* in X-Data or program memory, while the delays must be allocated solely
* in Y-Data memory.

*
* Interface to IIR filter operations.
*
* Filtering a data sequence x[n] with an IIR filter of impulse response
* {b[m] (0<= m < M), a[p] (0 <= p < P)} is equivalent to solving the
* difference equation:
*
*       sum_{p = 0:P-1}(a[p]*y[n-p]) = sum_{m = 0:M-1}(b[m]*x[n-m])
*
* In this operation it is important to know and manage the past history
* of the input and output data sequences (x[m], -M+1 <= m < 0, and y[p],
* -P+1 <= p < 0) which represent the initial conditions of the filtering
* operation. Also, when applying an IIR filter to contiguous sections of
* a data sequence it is necessary to remember the final state of the
* last filtering operation (x[m], N-M+1 <= m < N-1, and y[p], N-P+1 <= p < N-1),
* and take the state into consideration for the calculations of the next
* filtering stage. Accounting for the past history and current state is
* required to perform a correct (glitch-free) filtering operation.
*
* The management of the past history and current state of the filtering
* operation is commonly implemented via additional sequences, referred
* to as the delays. Prior to a filtering operation the delays describe the
* past history of the filter. After performing the IIR filtering operation
* the delays contain a set of the most recently filtered data samples, and
* of the most recent output samples. (For correct operation, it is advisable
* to initialize the delay values to zero by calling the corresponding init
* function.)
*
* Even though IIR filtering is a difference equation, several properties
* of IIR filters allow for computation of the operation in more effective
* ways than that of a straight difference equation. Consequently, a set
* of such implementations are hereby provided.
*
* Note that of the six main sequences involved in IIR filtering, input
* data, output data, filter coefficients (a,b) and delays, the last four
* are usually thought of as making up the filter structure. However, since
* different implementations allow for particular arrangaments of the filter
* structure for efficiency gain, the structure has not been standardized,
* but rather taylored to best fit the particular implementations.
*
* In the current design, the input data sequence is referred to as the
* sequence of source samples, while the resulting filtered sequence
* contains the destination samples. The filters are characterized by
* the number of coefficients or taps in the 'a' and 'b' sets, and the
* delay properties. All of these data sets are stored in memory as
* vectors with their elements representing Q.15 fractional quantities.
* Also, except for the 'IIRLattice' and associated 'IIRLatticeStruct'
* implementations, the filters are made up of cascaded second order
* sections. In all cases, the input, output and coefficient vectors
* are allocated in default RAM memory space (X-Data and Y-Data). The
* coefficients may be allocated in either X-Data or program memory,
* while the delays ought to be in Y-Data.

*
* Interface to transform operations.
*
* A set of linear discrete signal transformations (and some of the inverse
* transforms) are prototyped below. The first set applies a Discrete Fourier
* transform (or its inverse) to a complex data set. The second set applies
* a Type II Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to a real valued sequence.
*
* A complex valued sequence is represented by a vector in which every pair
* of values corresponds with a sequence element. The first value in the pair
* is the real part of the element, and the second its imaginary part (see
* the declaration of the 'fractcomplex' structure at the beginning of this
* file for further details). Both, the real and imaginary parts, are stored
* in memory using one word (two bytes) each, and must be interpreted as Q.15
* fractionals.
*
* The following transforms have been designed to either operate out-of-place,
* or in-place. The former type populates an output sequence with the results
* of the transformation. In the latter, the input sequence is (physically)
* replaced by the transformed sequence. For out-of-place operations, the user
* must provide with enough memory to accept the results of the computation.
* The input and output sequences to the FFT family of transforms must be
* allocated in Y-Data memopry.
*
* The transforms here described make use of transform factors which must be
* supplied to the transforming function during its invokation. These factors,
* which are complex data sets, are computed in floating point arithmetic,
* and then transformed into fractionals for use by the operations. To avoid
* excessive overhead when applying a transformation, and since for a given
* transform size the values of the factors are fixed, a particular set of
* transform factors could be generated once and used many times during the
* execution of the program. Thus, it is advisable to store the factors
* returned by any of the initialization operations in a permanent (static)
* vector. The factors to a transform may be allocated either in X-Data or
* program memory.
*
* Additional remarks.
*
* A) Operations which return a destination vector can be nested, so that
*    for instance if:
*
*       a = Op1 (b, c), with b = Op2 (d), and c = Op3 (e, f), then
*
*       a = Op1 (Op2 (d), Op3 (e, f))
