#  Override,***Override path description****
#  Control,Servo Channel,Xplane control surface path,Servo zero,Servo High Travel,Servo Low Travel,Surface Max travel,Surface Min Travel
#  Engine,Servo Channel,Engine Mask,Servo Zero,Servo High Travel,Servo Low Travel,Engine Max,Engine Min
#  
#  To comment out any line in the setup, change the first word before the comma.  
# 
#  The surface and override paths are defined in the xsquarkbox data references file
#  http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/docs/DataRefs.html
#  
#  If you need simple control choose the joystick override.
#  If you need to translate servos to flying surfaces choose full surface override.
#  
#  Surface travel is normally in degrees.  Read the XPlane documentation
#  Servo Hi and Low travel is defined by the relative count travelled from zero, 
# 	not the absolute value.
#  
#  The engine mask is a bitfield Bit0 = engine 1, Bit 7 = engine 8.
#  
#  If you need to control all engines together on one channel, choose mask 255
#  
#  Use your transmitter and/or autopilot to do the mixing.
#  
#  THIS SETUP WILL NOT DO INTER-CHANNEL MIXING.  This feature is to be added if needed. 
#  This might be a problem for some heli setups.
