Description: A MAVLink protocol proxy and ground station. MAVProxy
        is oriented towards command line operation, and is suitable for embedding in
        small autonomous vehicles or for using on ground control stations. It also
        features a number of graphical tools such as a slipmap for satellite mapping
        view of the vehicles location, and status console and several useful vehicle
        control modules. MAVProxy is extensible via a modules system - see the modules
        subdirectory for some example modules. MAVProxy was developed by CanberraUAV
        for use in the 2012 Outback Challenge, and includes a module for the
        CanberraUAV search and rescue system. See
        http://tridge.github.io/MAVProxy/ for more information
        on how to use MAVProxy.
